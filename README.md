# Description
Our team created a website that will allow it's viewers to learn more about the Marvel characters as well as what movies they part take in.

# Usage
In the home page the user has access to a search bar where marvel characters will auto populate if the user is not familiar with marvel characters. After searching a character the character will appear as well as a mini biography and a list of movies where that character is included. The user has the ability to click on the movies which a screen will populate showing the user the plot of the moview, ratings, year and the ability to add it to their watchlist. The marvel image will serve as a home button allowing the user to return back to the home page.
